The Schwarzschild criterion for convective stability is
\begin{equation}
    \yS \equiv \gradrad - \gradad < 0,
    \label{eqn:yS}
\end{equation}
whereas the Ledoux criterion for convective stability is
\begin{equation}
    \yL \equiv \yS +  \frac{\chi_\mu}{\chi_T}\gradmu < 0.
    \label{eqn:yL}
\end{equation}
The temperature gradient $\justgrad \equiv d \ln P / d \ln T$ (pressure $P$ and temperature $T$) is $\gradad$ for an adiabatic stratification and $\gradrad$ if the flux is entirely carried radiatively.
The Ledoux criterion includes the effects of the composition gradient $\gradmu = d\ln\mu/d\ln P$ (mean molecular weight $\mu$), where $\chi_T = (d\ln P / d\ln T)_{\rho,\mu}$ and $\chi_\mu = (d\ln P / d\ln\mu)_{\rho,T}$ (density $\rho$).

Stellar structure software instruments assume that the location of convective boundaries coincide with sign changes of $\yL$ or $\yS$ \citep[][sec.~2]{mesa4}..
The various stability regimes which can occur in stars are described in section 3 and figure 3 of \citet{salaris_cassisi_2017}, but note four important regimes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Convection Zones (CZs): Regions with both $\yS > 0$ and $\yL > 0$ are convectively unstable.
    \item Radiative Zones (RZs): Regions with $\yS < 0$ and $\yL \leq \yS$ are always stable to convection.
        Other combinations of $\yL$ and $\yS$ may also be RZs, as detailed below in \#3 and \#4.
    \item ``Semiconvection'' Zones (SZs): Regions with $\yS > 0$ but $\yL < 0$ are stablized to convection by a composition gradient despite an unstable thermal stratification.
        These regions can be stable RZs or linearly unstable to oscillatory double-diffusive convection \citep[ODDC, see][chapters 2 and 4]{garaud_2018}.
    \item ``Thermohaline'' Zones: Regions with $\yS < 0$ and $\yL > \yS$ are thermally stable to convection despite an unstable composition gradient.
        These regions can be stable RZs or linearly unstable to thermohaline mixing \citep[see][chapters 2 and 3]{garaud_2018}.
\end{enumerate}
In this letter, we study a three-layer 3D simulation of convection.
The initial structure of the simulation is an unstable CZ (bottom, \#1), a compositionally-stabilized SZ (middle, \#3), and a thermally stable RZ (top, \#2).
We examine how the boundary of the CZ evolves through entrainment.
In particular, we are interested in seeing if the roots of $\yS$ and $\yL$ coincide on timescales that are long compared to the dynamical timescale but short compared to evolutionary timescales.

In this work, we utilize a 3D model employing the Boussinesq approximation, which is formally valid when motions occur on length scales much smaller than the pressure scale height.
This approximation fully captures the primary focus of this work, which is nonlinear advective mixing near the CZ-SZ boundary.
Our simulations use a height-dependent $\gradrad$ and buoyancy is determined by a combination of the composition $\mu$ and the temperature stratification $T$, so $\yS$ and $\yL$ are determined independently and self-consistently.
For details on our model setup and Dedalus simulations, we refer the reader to appendices \ref{app:model} and \ref{app:simulation_details}.

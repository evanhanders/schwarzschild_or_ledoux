\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item We simulated X.
\item These simulations demonstrate that the Schwarzschild criterion provides a good estimate of the boundary of the unstable convection zone.
\item This analysis ignores secondary effects \citep[e.g., convective penetration][because we designed our experiments to minimize these effects]{anders_etal_2022}.
\item These results provide evidence from 3D dynamical simulations that modern implementations of MLT \citep{mesa4, mesa5} which are more logically consistent \citep{gabriel_etal_2014} are more accurate.
\end{itemize}
